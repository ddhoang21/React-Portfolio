            <h2 className="text-center">About Me</h2>

            <p class="text-bio">I was born and raised in Belgium but I went to live in Vietnam when I was 8. I came to
                the United States in 2009 to finish my studies. I
                graduated from the University of Washington in 2016 with a double bachelorâ€™s in Communications and
                International
                Relations. I currently am working as a Tech Support for Blueprint Technologies and have been there for 3
                years.
                Football (soccer) is my passion. I have been playing it since I was 10 and love to watch it. My favorite
                league is the English Premier League because it is the most competitive. My favorite club is Real
                Madrid. I have been supporting them since I was a child; it is a legendary team. During my free time, I
                enjoy going to the bar and watch football games with friends.
